👋 Heya! I'm a student at Brown studying Math, Computer Science and Visual Arts. I also love design 🖋️, photography 📷, and data journalism 📊. I grew up in Hong Kong and currently live in Shanghai and Providence, RI. 

My pronouns are *he/him/his*.

### [projects 🔗](/projects/)

Some of the projects I've worked on over the years. Additionally, 

- 🗺️ Take a look at [Districtr](https://districtr.org/)! I've previously contributed extensively to voter rights and districting/gerrymandering research. This includes [data collection](https://districtr.org/nebraska) and [theoretical research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09792). 
- 🔧 I like [hackathons](https://devpost.com/Jiahua) (occasionally). Reach out if you wanna work with me on anything! 
- 🖊️ I take course notes for math courses at Brown and they are public: [Math 1560](https://jchen.github.io/math1560-notes/notes.pdf); [Math 1580](https://jchen.github.io/math1580-notes/notes.pdf). 

### [writing 🔗](/writing/)

Me writing about anything and everything that interests me (condition, of course, on my rapidly decreasing motivation to write). Enjoy.
