Hey! I'm a student at Brown studying Math, Computer Science and Visual Arts. I love design, photography, data journalism, and occasionally a dash of formal methods.

I grew up in Hong Kong and currently live in Shanghai and Providence, RI. My pronouns are _he/him/his_.

I've been a TA for courses like discrete math, programming languages, compilers, and applied cryptography. I'm passionate about the TA program at Brown and work as an [MTA](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/jobs/meta-ta/) to support TAs in their role. 

Here are my course notes for [Math 1560 (Number Theory)](https://jchen.github.io/math1560-notes/notes.pdf) and [CSCI 1515 (Applied Cryptography)](https://github.com/BrownAppliedCryptography/notes/blob/df4c2ec2954ebfe4ef7fe87f9fd9ca3fa54eca64/notes.pdf). Other course notes at varying levels of completion are available on my GitHub. 

{/* ### [projects](/projects/)

View my [projects page](/projects/) to take a look at some of the (more or less randomish) projects I've worked on over the years. Additionally,

-   Take a look at [Districtr](https://districtr.org/)! I've previously contributed to voter rights and districting/gerrymandering research. This includes [data collection](https://districtr.org/nebraska) and [theoretical research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09792).
-   I take course notes for select math courses (some of the time) at Brown and they are public (some are more complete than others):
    -   Spring 2022: [Math 1560](https://jchen.github.io/math1560-notes/notes.pdf); [Math 1580](https://jchen.github.io/math1580-notes/notes.pdf).
    -   Spring 2023: [Math 1010](https://jchen.github.io/math1010-notes/notes.pdf); [CSCI 1515](https://brownappliedcryptography.github.io/notes/notes.pdf).

### [writing](/writing/)

Me writing about anything and everything that interests me (condition, of course, on my rapidly decreasing motivation to write). */}

### contact

Please feel more than free to reach out to me [here](mailto:hey@jiahua.io). A copy of my résumé is available on request.
