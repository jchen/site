Hey! I'm Jiahua (he/him). I love design, photography, data journalism, and occasionally a dash of formal methods. 

I recently graduated from Brown University, where I studied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Visual Arts. There, I was a TA for courses like discrete math, programming languages, compilers, and applied cryptography. I'm passionate about the TA program at Brown and worked as an [MTA](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/jobs/meta-ta/) to support TAs in their role. I'm currently in the process of moving to NYC.
