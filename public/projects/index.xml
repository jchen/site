Inspiration Networking is hard, and COVID-19 has only made it harder. Keeping track of all of the people you&amp;rsquo;ve met and then remembering to follow up is exhausting. In the past, you could at least hand out your business card or copies of your resume to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re remembered, but social distancing has made that a thing of the past.</description>

Inspiration Apple and Google have developed private and secure exposure notification options within their ecosystems and operating systems. However, these systems are open to the general public and require pre-enrollment. Only a fraction of the population is enrolled and even fewer choose to report their exposures. Within a closed environment, such as a school, university or large office - there has to be a solution that complements existing preventative measures (for example, Brown tests on-campus populations biweekly) to provide richer exposure notifications and campuswide data while maintaining user privacy.</description>

Abstract Over the last decade, there has been a lot of interest in the process of automated picture colorization for a variety of applications, including the restoration of old or deteriorated photos. Due to the high degrees of freedom in the assignment of color information, this problem is extremely ill-posed. Many recent advances in automatic colorization involve images with a shared theme or need highly processed data as input, such as semantic maps.</description>

Inspiration Remote learning is becoming more and more prevalent in the wake of COVID-19, especially through Zoom. Unfortunately, many teachers have difficulty creating an interactive environment with Zoom: polling is frustrating to use, student questions get lost in the chat, and the &amp;ldquo;raise hand&amp;rdquo; feature disrupts the flow of lectures. In addition, a lot of students lack the powerful wifi connection required for Zoom, which means they might lose access to a lecture partway through.</description>
